1. Name the 3 pools for memory and what kind of variables will be stored in each pool.
The three different pools of memory: a static, stack, heap. Static is a global variable that can be used throughtout the code.
stack is a local variable and heap is dynamic storage.


2. Open mem.c with your favorite text editor and discuss the following questions with your partner:
a. How many variables are declared?

There are 3 variables are declared.

b. How many of them are pointers? What type of data does each pointer point to?

There is 2 pointers. The pointer ptr is points to num and handle points to ptr which points to num.

c. Which pool of memory are these variables stored in?

They all are stored in the stack

d. Which pool of memory will the pointer ptr point to in line 12.

It points too the heap since malloc is being called.

3. Using a piece of paper (or a drawing app), draw the 3 pools of memory and indicate the locations (in
which pool?) of the variables in mem.c using boxes (like what we did in lecture). Label the boxes with
variable names, their content, and their addresses. You will need to insert extra code to obtain the
addresses of these variables.


4. In the same drawing, use arrows to connect each pointer to its destination





TPS #2

1. Open NodeStruct.c and discuss what this program does
I think that nodeStruct.c declares  pointer and allocated memory in the heap for a Node Struct. Then assigns node head to the two values by pointers.



2. Insert extra code to print out the value of head, addresses of head, iValue, fValue, and next pointed
by head.
Done.


3. Based on the addresses of the members of Node structure, what do you observe about how structures
are stored in memory? What is the relationship between the pointer (head) and its destination (the
Node structure)?

Head Points the Node stuct and stores them one after another.That is why it is four bits apart since each memory takes 4 bits.
